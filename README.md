# prl_experiment

Contains files of a uni-project on programming experiments in Matlab using [Psychtoolbox 3](http://psychtoolbox.org/).

The proposed experiment is set up to investigate cognitive control in persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ADD) based on a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task.

* read [this short paper](https://github.com/felixschltr/prl_experiment/blob/master/experimentidee.pdf) (in German) to find out more about the idea behind the experiment

* see the [.m-file](https://github.com/felixschltr/prl_experiment/blob/master/PRL_experiment.m) for the code

* see the [.csv-file](https://github.com/felixschltr/prl_experiment/blob/master/PRL_data_example.csv) for an example data file generated by program

* see [this PDF](https://github.com/felixschltr/prl_experiment/blob/master/data_file_instructions.pdf) for explanation on all variables saved in the data file
